# Saturation Plugins

A collection of plugins that add warmth and character to your music. These effects can make digital music sound more analog-like and add pleasant richness to the sound, similar to how vintage audio equipment colors the sound.

## Plugin List

- [Hard Clipping](#hard-clipping) - Adds intensity and edge to the sound
- [Multiband Saturation](#multiband-saturation) - Shape and enhance different frequency ranges independently
- [Saturation](#saturation) - Adds warmth and richness like vintage equipment
- [Sub Synth](#sub-synth) - Generates and mixes subharmonic signals for bass enhancement

## Hard Clipping

- Creative Effect:
  - Creates dramatic sound transformations
  - Adds aggressive character to the music
  - Perfect for experimental listening

### Parameters
- **Threshold** - Controls how much of the sound is affected (-60dB to 0dB)
  - Higher values (-6dB to 0dB): Subtle warmth
  - Middle values (-24dB to -6dB): Notable character
  - Lower values (-60dB to -24dB): Dramatic effect
- **Mode** - Chooses which parts of the sound to affect
