# Delay Plugins

A collection of tools for adjusting the timing of your audio signals. These plugins help you fine-tune the temporal alignment of your audio, which is particularly useful for precise stereo imaging and phase correction.

## Plugin List

- [Time Alignment](#time-alignment) - Precise timing adjustments for audio channels

## Time Alignment

A precision tool that lets you adjust the timing of audio channels with millisecond accuracy. Perfect for correcting phase issues or creating specific stereo effects.

### When to Use
- Fixing phase alignment between stereo channels
- Compensating for speaker distance differences
- Fine-tuning stereo imaging
- Correcting timing mismatches in recordings

### Parameters
- **Delay** - Controls the delay time (0 to 100ms)
  - 0ms: No delay (original timing)
  - Higher values: Increased delay
  - Fine adjustments for precise control
- **Channel** - Select which channel to delay
  - All: Affects both channels
  - Left: Only delays left channel
  - Right: Only delays right channel

### Recommended Uses
