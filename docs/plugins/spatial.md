# Spatial Audio Plugins

A collection of plugins that enhance how music sounds in your headphones or speakers by adjusting the stereo (left and right) balance. These effects can make your music sound more spacious and natural, especially when listening with headphones.

## Plugin List

- [Stereo Blend](#stereo-blend) - Controls stereo width from mono to enhanced stereo

## Stereo Blend

An effect that helps achieve a more natural sound field by adjusting the stereo width of your music. It's particularly useful for headphone listening, where it can reduce the exaggerated stereo separation that often occurs with headphones, making the listening experience more natural and less fatiguing. It can also enhance the stereo image for speaker listening when needed.
