# Modulation Plugins

A collection of plugins that add movement and variation to your music through modulation effects. These effects can make your digital music feel more organic and dynamic, enhancing your listening experience with subtle or dramatic variations in sound.

## Plugin List

- [Pitch Shifter](#pitch-shifter) - Changes the pitch of your music without affecting playback speed
- [Tremolo](#tremolo) - Creates rhythmic volume variations for a pulsing, dynamic sound
- [Wow Flutter](#wow-flutter) - Recreates the gentle pitch variations of vinyl records and tape players

## Pitch Shifter

An effect that changes the pitch of your music without affecting its playback speed. This allows you to experience your favorite songs in different keys, making them sound higher or lower while maintaining the original tempo and rhythm.

### Parameters
- **Pitch Shift** - Changes the overall pitch in semitones (-6 to +6)
  - Negative values: Lowers the pitch (deeper, lower sound)
  - Zero: No change (original pitch)
  - Positive values: Raises the pitch (higher, brighter sound)
- **Fine Tune** - Makes subtle pitch adjustments in cents (-50 to +50)
  - Allows for precise tuning between semitones
  - Perfect for minor adjustments when a full semitone is too much
- **Window Size** - Controls the analysis window size in milliseconds (80 to 500ms)
  - Smaller values (80-150ms): Better for transient-rich material like percussion
  - Medium values (150-300ms): Good balance for most music
  - Larger values (300-500ms): Better for smooth, sustained sounds
- **XFade Time** - Sets the crossfade time between processed segments in milliseconds (20 to 40ms)
  - Affects how smoothly the pitch-shifted segments blend together
  - Lower values may sound more immediate but potentially less smooth
  - Higher values create smoother transitions between segments, but may increase sound wavering and create an overlapping sensation

## Tremolo

An effect that adds rhythmic volume variations to your music, similar to the pulsing sound found in vintage amplifiers and classic recordings. This creates a dynamic, expressive quality that adds movement and interest to your listening experience.

### Listening Experience Guide

  - Perfect for ambient and atmospheric listening

### Parameters
- **Rate** - How fast the volume changes (0.1 to 20 Hz)
  - Slower (0.1-2 Hz): Gentle, subtle pulsing
  - Medium (2-6 Hz): Classic tremolo effect
  - Faster (6-20 Hz): Dramatic, choppy effects
- **Depth** - How much the volume changes (0 to 12 dB)
  - Subtle (0-3 dB): Gentle volume variations
  - Medium (3-6 dB): Noticeable pulsing effect
  - Strong (6-12 dB): Dramatic volume swells
- **Ch Phase** - Phase difference between stereo channels (-180 to 180 degrees)
  - 0°: Both channels pulse together (mono tremolo)
  - 90° or -90°: Creates a swirling, rotating effect
  - 180° or -180°: Channels pulse in opposite directions (maximum stereo width)
- **Randomness** - How irregular the volume changes become (0 to 96 dB)
  - Low: More predictable, regular pulsing
  - Medium: Natural vintage variation
  - High: More unstable, organic sound
- **Randomness Cutoff** - How quickly the random changes happen (1 to 1000 Hz)
  - Lower: Slower, more gentle random variations
  - Higher: Quicker, more erratic changes
- **Ch Sync** - How synchronized the randomness is between channels (0 to 100%)
  - 0%: Each channel has independent randomness
  - 50%: Partial synchronization between channels
  - 100%: Both channels share the same randomness pattern
