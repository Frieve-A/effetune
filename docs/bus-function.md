# How to Use the Bus Feature

The Bus feature enables flexible audio routing between effects, allowing more complex and versatile audio processing.

## Basic Concept

- Each effect allows you to specify an **Input Bus** that receives the audio signal to be processed, and an **Output Bus** that outputs the processed audio.
- By default, if not specified otherwise, each effect uses **Main bus** for both input and output.
- Up to four additional buses (**Bus 1 to Bus 4**) can be used.

## Setting Input and Output Buses for Effects

- Click the **Routing button** located to the left of the up/down buttons displayed on each effect.
- Clicking the Routing button opens a settings dialog, allowing free selection of the Input Bus and Output Bus from Main or Bus 1 to Bus 4.
- Changes take effect immediately.
- To close the dialog, click the × button at the top-right corner or click outside the dialog.

- If either the input or output is set to Bus 1 or higher, "Bus X→Bus Y" will be displayed next to the Routing button.
  - Example: When processing audio from Bus 2 and outputting it to Bus 3, it will show "Bus 2→Bus 3".

## Audio Processing Mechanism

- Effects are processed sequentially from top to bottom.
- Each effect takes audio signals from the specified Input Bus, processes them, and sends the result to the Output Bus.
- If an Input Bus is used for the first time, processing begins from silence.
- If the Input and Output Buses are the same, the Output Bus audio is overwritten by the processed result.
- If different buses are specified for input and output, the processed audio is added to the Output Bus.
- Ultimately, audio playback is always from **Main bus**.
