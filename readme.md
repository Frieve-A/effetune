## Setup Guide

Before using EffeTune, you'll need to set up your audio routing. Here's how to configure different audio sources:

### Streaming Service Setup

To process audio from streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.):

1. Prerequisites:
   - Install a virtual audio device (e.g., VB Cable, Voice Meeter, or ASIO Link Tool)
   - Configure your streaming service to output audio to the virtual audio device

2. Configuration:
   - Launch EffeTune
   - Select the virtual audio device as your input source
   - Start playing music from your streaming service
   - Verify that audio is flowing through EffeTune
   - Add effects to the Pipeline to enhance your listening experience

### Physical Audio Source Setup

To use EffeTune with CD players, network players, or other physical sources:

1. Configuration:
   - Connect your audio interface to your computer
   - Launch EffeTune
   - Select your audio interface as the input source
   - Configure your browser's audio output to your audio interface
   - Your audio interface now functions as a multi-effects processor:
     * Input: Your CD player, network player, or other audio source
     * Processing: Real-time effects through EffeTune
     * Output: Processed audio to your amplifier or speakers

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
1. Dropouts or Glitches
   - Click "Reset Audio" to rebuild the audio pipeline
   - Try reducing the number of active effects
   - Close other browser tabs using audio

2. High CPU Usage

   - Check parameter settings
   - Try removing and re-adding the effect

3. Sharing Issues
   - Use the "Share" button to generate a URL
   - Copy the entire URL when sharing
   - Test the shared link in a new browser window

## FAQ

Q. Does this app support surround sound?
A. Currently, due to browser limitations, we cannot handle more than 2 channels in the browser, and there is no proven track record of surround sound operation. While the plugin implementation itself supports surround sound, we'll need to wait for future browser support.

Q. What's the recommended effect chain length?
A. While there's no strict limit, we recommend keeping your effect chain to 8-10 effects for optimal performance. More complex chains may impact system performance.

Q. Can I save my favorite effect combinations?
A. Yes! Use the "Share" button to generate a URL that contains your entire effect chain configuration. Bookmark this URL to save your settings.

Q. How do I achieve the best sound quality?
A. Use 96kHz sample rate when possible, start with subtle effect settings, and build your chain gradually. Monitor levels to avoid distortion.

Q. Will this work with any audio source?
A. Yes, EffeTune can process any audio playing through your selected input device, including streaming services, local files, and physical media.
