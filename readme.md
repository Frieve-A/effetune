## Usage

### Building Your Effect Chain

1. Available plugins are listed on the left side of the screen
2. Drag plugins from the list to the Effect Pipeline area
3. Plugins are processed in order from top to bottom
4. Use the handle (â‹®) to reorder plugins by dragging

1. After setting up your desired effect chain, click the "Share" button in the top-right corner of the Effect Pipeline area
2. The URL will be automatically copied to your clipboard
3. Share the copied URL with others - they can recreate your exact effect chain by opening it
4. All effect settings are stored in the URL, making them easy to save and share

### Audio Reset

If you experience audio issues (dropouts, glitches):
